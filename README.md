# home-assistant

My first attempt at running a home automation system was a Shelly device integrated to HomeKit - worked nicely. Then I fiddled around with running https://homebridge.io/ on my Raspberry 4, moved over to https://hoobs.org/ and realized that there must be something better. Luckily I found Home Assistant.

## My goal

Have a nice and easy interface for the house on the iPad (no need for my wife and kids to access any of the Home Assistant stuff). Have an advanced interface to the house for myself.

This file is intended for me to document the quirks I had during setup and for others to learn and avoid them.

## My setup

* Router Fritz!Box 7490 with open external ports 443 and 8123 to the Raspberry 4 (no DynDNS on fritz.box)
  * my doorbell is directly hooked up to the Fritzbox
  * Fritzbox has an attached USB stick
* Raspberry 4 running Home Assistant 2021.1.5
  * initially connected thru wifi, later moved to ethernet and directly connected to the Fritzbox
  * conbee USB stick to manage ZigBee network
* Regular backup to a samba share (described below)
* Regular updates to git (described below)
* I run a bunch of add-ons, described in the following sections.

## AdGuard Home 

* filters out ads and other stuff (serves as DNS-server for the Fritzbox)

```
ssl: true
certfile: fullchain.pem
keyfile: privkey.pem
```

## DSS VoIP Notifier

* using my Fritzbox as a SIP server (HA can iniate calls and play audio stuff using tts)
* install https://github.com/sdesalve/hassio-addons/tree/master/dss_voip
* enable tts like https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/google_translate
```
tts:
  - platform: google_translate
    language: 'de'
    service_name: google_translate_say
    base_url: https://xxx.duckdns.org
```
* configuration (note that ```192.168.178.1``` is the IP address of my Fritzbox, and ```192.168.178.83``` is the IP address of my raspberry
```
sip_parameters:
  caller_id_uri: 'sip:homeassistant@192.168.178.1:5060'
  realm: '*'
  username: homeassistant
  password: '<replace-me-with-digits-only>'
pjsua_custom_options: '--ip-addr=192.168.178.83'
```
* steps to do on Fritzbox:, see https://superuser.com/questions/829824/android-wont-register-sip-on-Fritzbox-router
  * log on to your Fritzbox
  * select TelefoniegerÃ¤te (phone | devices)
  * Add Phone
  * LAN/WLAN (IP Phone), named 'homeassistant'
  * enter username homeassistant, passwort ONLY digits
  * pick a number (any number will do)
  * don't accept any outside calls (not required in my case)
  * my Fritzbox registered a new device with internal number *622
* now try calling the service like (e.g. from the "Developer Tools" section in HA)

```
- service: hassio.addon_stdin
  data_template:
	addon: 89275b70_dss_voip
	input: {"call_sip_uri":"sip:**614@192.168.178.1","message_tts":"Hallo Stefan"}
```
* in above  case **614 is my internal office number

## DuckDNS

* I want to access my HA instance remotely, so I needed a DNS name and Let's Encrypt support.

```
lets_encrypt:
  accept_terms: true
  certfile: fullchain.pem
  keyfile: privkey.pem
token: ##replaceme##
domains:
  - xxx.duckdns.org
aliases: []
seconds: 300
```

## File editor

* to remotely edit files

## Glances 

* to monitor the Raspberry

```
log_level: info
process_info: false
refresh_time: 10
ssl: false
certfile: fullchain.pem
keyfile: privkey.pem
influxdb:
  enabled: false
  host: ##replaceme##
  port: 8086
  username: glances
  password: '!secret glances_influxdb_password'
  database: glances
  prefix: localhost
  interval: 60
```

## Log Viewer

* to check log files (what else?)


## MariaDB

* Moved from Sqlite to using this https://community.home-assistant.io/t/migrating-home-assistant-database-from-sqlite-to-mariadb/96895/23

## NGINX Home Assistant SSL proxy

* forwards incoming SSL traffic from Fritzbox to HA
```
domain: xxx.duckdns.org
certfile: fullchain.pem
keyfile: privkey.pem
hsts: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
cloudflare: false
customize:
  active: false
  default: nginx_proxy_default*.conf
  servers: nginx_proxy/*.conf
```

## SSH & Web Terminal

* not to be confused with "Terminal & SSH"
* this is as special version which gives me elevated access to the Raspberry

```
ssh:
  username: hassio
  password: ''
  authorized_keys: ##replaceme##
  sftp: false
  compatibility_mode: false
  allow_agent_forwarding: false
  allow_remote_port_forwarding: false
  allow_tcp_forwarding: false
zsh: true
share_sessions: false
packages: []
init_commands: []
```

## Samba Backup 

* to have regular config backups to the USB stick of the Fritzbox
* note that username ##replaceme## must be available on the Fritzbox ("System > FRITZ!Box-Benutzer > Benutzer") and that particular user requires access to the attached USB stick

```
host: 192.168.178.1
share: FRITZ.NAS
target_dir: CCCOMA_X64F\ha
username: ##replaceme##
password: ##replaceme##
keep_local: 14
keep_remote: all
trigger_time: '00:00'
trigger_days:
  - Mon

  - Wed
  - Thu
  - Fri
  - Sat
  - Sun
exclude_addons: []
exclude_folders: []
backup_name: '{type} Snapshot {version} {date}'
```

## Samba share

* to be able to access and edit files on the Raspberry from a Windows machine

```
workgroup: WORKGROUP
username: ##replaceme##
password: ##replaceme##
interface: ''
allow_hosts:
  - 10.0.0.0/8
  - 172.16.0.0/12

  - 'fe80::/10'
veto_files:
  - ._*
  - .DS_Store
  - Thumbs.db
  - icon?
  - .Trashes
compatibility_mode: false
```

## deCONZ

* to run my ZigBee devices


## motionEye

* an old iPhone serving as a guinea pig camera
* for motionEye's webhooks I had to install NGINX as add-on (see https://community.home-assistant.io/t/motioneye-integration/194350/42)
* triggers action if motion is detected 

# Useful stuff
* an automation to regularly update my config to github (see https://github.com/swa72/home-assistant/blob/main/automations.yaml), credit: https://peyanski.com/automatic-home-assistant-backup-to-github/

```
