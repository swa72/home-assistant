# MHI-AC-Ctrl-ESPHome
This project is a simple integration of the amazing work [absalom-muc](https://github.com/absalom-muc) has done with his project [MHI-AC-Ctrl](https://github.com/absalom-muc/MHI-AC-Ctrl).\
It's supposed to simplify the [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) setup, while giving you OTA and auto-discovery with virtually zero effort and no MQTT needed, powered by [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/).\
MHI-AC-Ctrl-core.\* files were forked directly, with no modification, whereas your WiFi credentials should go into the \*.yaml file, and mhi_ac_ctrl.h is the core of the integration.\
Just put all these files in your ESPHome folder, flash once, and you're good to go!
